# Revision-of-JavaScript-Part-2
Revision of JS that I did earlier in 2024.

## JavaScript Revision: Loops, Functions, and Object-Oriented Programming
This script revisits essential JavaScript concepts, including control flow, functions, object prototypes, and class-based programming. It serves as a thorough practice file for understanding how various JavaScript features work, from simple loops to more advanced topics like classes and inheritance.

## Key Topics Covered

## Loops
For Loop: Demonstrating nested loops to iterate over a range of numbers.
While Loop: Executing a block of code repeatedly as long as a condition is met.
Do-While Loop: Ensuring code runs at least once before checking the loop condition.
Break and Continue: Using control statements to manage the flow within loops.

## Functions
Function Declarations and Parameters: Examples of simple functions and functions with parameters.
Default Parameters: Demonstrating how to assign default values to function parameters.
Callback Functions: Showing how to pass functions as arguments and execute them.
Anonymous and Self-Invoking Functions: Immediate execution of functions for encapsulation.
Recursive Functions: An example of a function calling itself to perform a countdown.

## Object-Oriented Programming
Object Prototypes: Using function constructors and prototype properties to create and extend objects.
Object Destructuring: Extracting properties from objects for simplified access.
JavaScript Classes: Introducing classes, constructors, and methods for object creation.
Class Inheritance: Using inheritance to extend class functionality, including static methods and private fields.
